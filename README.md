# The local website database
We are living in different countries with different languages, but around the world, every state has at least one local websites for;

* Find an Apartment
* Order Food
* Buy/Sell Car
* Buy/Sell House
* Buy/Sell Second-hand Furniture

The local website database will help you to find specific websites for your country.
