# The local website database
We are living in different countries with different languages, but around the world, every state has at least one local websites for;

* Find an Apartment
* Order Food
* Buy/Sell Car
* Buy/Sell House
* Buy/Sell Second-hand Furniture

The local website database will help you to find specific websites for your country.

Do you want to add your country? Let's check [How can I add another country](#how-can-I-add-another-country)!

# Project Set-up
Install all dependencies
```
npm install
```

Run project;
``` 
npm start
```

# How can I add another country?
1. Create a new branch
2. Create a JSON file in `data/countries/` directory. (You can find a dummy json in this directory, you can copy it!)
3. Add an import in `countries.js` file.
4. Test it locally
5. Create a PR then you are pretty set! ðŸŽ‰
